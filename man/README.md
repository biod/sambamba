# Guide for developers

## Ronn

All documentation is written in Markdown format with `.ronn` extension.

[Ronn](https://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/) is a generator that can produce both man pages and HTML snippets. 
You can install it as a Ruby gem or through your package manager (`ruby-ronn` on Ubuntu).

During editing, it's very helpful to check that output looks as intended; 
this is done by running `ronn -m <filename.ronn>` which will launch the man pager.

## Generated files

* Man pages, generated by `ronn -r`, currently go here, alongside `.ronn` files.
* HTML snippets are generated by `ronn -f` and go into `gh-pages` branch. 
The branch should be cloned to a separate directory on your machine, 
and the destination for the snippets (`.html_fragment` extension) is the `_includes` directory.
